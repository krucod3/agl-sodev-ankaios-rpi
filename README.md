A **Raspberry Pi 5** port of the AGL (Automotive Grade Linux) SoDeV
disaggregated-cockpit demo (R-Car V4H / Sparrow Hawk): **Xen 4.22** running a
minimal control Dom0 (Zephyr by default, thin Linux as an alternative), a GPU
driver domain, an AGL instrument cluster and Android Automotive OS — dual
display, one board. **The build produces a bootable SD-card image (`full.img`)**
containing the selected domains. An RPi4-only proof of concept additionally
supports an AGL DomK guest that runs Eclipse Ankaios-managed containers.

This workspace complements
[`xen-troops/meta-xt-prod-devel-rpi5`](https://github.com/xen-troops/meta-xt-prod-devel-rpi5)
(whose default demo is a Zephyr Dom0 with Zephyr/Unikraft guests): here the
upstream layer set is extended into a full **SoDeV cockpit** on the same RPi5 BSP,
with two selectable Dom0 flavours (see *Build configuration*).

If you come from the V4H AGL SoDeV
([`automotive-grade-linux/sodev-demo-workspace`](https://github.com/automotive-grade-linux/sodev-demo-workspace)),
see *Differences vs the V4H AGL SoDeV* (`docs/DESIGN.md`) below for exactly what changed and what
was kept identical.

```
  Xen 4.22.0 (interim local 4.22 recipe + RPi5/virtio patch series)
  on Yocto Wrynose 6.0 LTS / Linux 6.18.33

  DOM0_OS=zephyr (default — disaggregated control plane)
  |- Dom0 : Zephyr, xenstore server only (no toolstack, no drivers)      [1 vCPU  @ pCPU 0]
  |- DomD : dom0less direct-mapped driver domain — vc4/v3d GPU, RP1,
  |         SDHCI, Mesa 26.0.5 + weston 15.0.0 + qemu 7.0.0 device-models,
  |         AND the xl toolstack that creates the optional guests        [2 vCPUs @ pCPU 0-1]
  |- DomU : AGL instrument cluster (Flutter cluster demo) -> HDMI-A-1    [1 vCPU  @ pCPU 1]
  |- DomA : Android Automotive OS (trout/xenvm)           -> HDMI-A-2    [2 vCPUs @ pCPU 2-3]
  |- DomZ : Zephyr RTOS domain (xenvm board)                             [1 vCPU  @ pCPU 0]

  RPi4 4 GiB DomK PoC (DOM0_OS=zephyr only)
  `- DomK : AGL + Ankaios server/agent + Podman/crun      -> HDMI-A-1    [1 vCPU  @ pCPU 3]

  DOM0_OS=linux (alternative — classic control plane)
  |- Dom0 : thin Linux control domain (xl toolstack, SD owner); DomD is
            still dom0less; Dom0's xl service chain creates DomU/DomA/DomZ.
```
The diagram shows the full 5-domain cockpit and the separate DomK PoC; **the
default build is Dom0 + DomD only** — DomU, DomA, DomZ and DomK are opt-in
(`-u`/`-a`/`-z`/`-k`, see *Build configuration*).

## Quick start (build the SD image)

Everything runs inside Docker: `build.sh` builds the container image on demand,
then runs moulin + ninja inside it. You only need **Docker** on the host (see
*System requirements*).

```sh
# 1. Get the sources (this repo uses git submodules)
git clone <this repository> && cd sodev-demo-workspace-rpi
git submodule update --init --recursive

# 2. Build the SD image  ->  full.img   (build.sh applies the Zephyr Dom0 patches for you)
./build.sh                       # DEFAULT: Raspberry Pi 5, Dom0(Zephyr) + DomD   (guest-less, fast)
# ./build.sh -u                  # + DomU (AGL instrument cluster)
# ./build.sh -u -a               # + DomU + DomA (AAOS) = the 4-domain cockpit
# ./build.sh -z                  # + DomZ (Zephyr RTOS domain)
# ./build.sh --dom0=linux -u -a  # thin Linux control Dom0 instead of Zephyr
# ./build.sh --board=rpi4 -u -a  # Raspberry Pi 4 (BCM2711) instead of Pi 5
# ./build.sh --board=rpi4 --ram=4g -k     # DomK Ankaios PoC, HDMI-A-1
# ./build.sh --board=rpi4 --ram=4g -k -u  # DomK + DomU, on HDMI-A-1/HDMI-A-2
# ./build.sh --board=rpi4 --ram=4g -k --domains-only  # domains, no full.img

# 3. Flash it to an SD card (double-check <sd-dev>!)
sudo dd if=full.img of=/dev/<sd-dev> bs=4M conv=fsync status=progress
```

The image is named after the configuration it contains, so building a second one
does not replace the first and a card you flashed months ago can still be
identified:

```
rpi5-16GB-Dom0Zephyr-DomU-DomA-20260809-1750.img
^^^^ ^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
board SKU  Dom0       guests    build date and time (local)
                      present
```

`full.img` is a symlink to the newest one, so the `dd` line above — and anything
else that refers to `full.img` — keeps working.

Before you build:
- The **default** image is guest-less (Dom0 + DomD): it boots but shows **no
  instrument cluster / Android** on the displays. The full dual-display demo
  needs `-u -a`.
- **`-k` / `--ankaios` enables the DomK PoC.** It currently requires
  `--board=rpi4 --ram=4g` and the default `--dom0=zephyr`, and cannot be combined
  with `-a` or any other DomA-enabling `--aaos` mode. DomK may be built alone or
  with `-u`; alone it owns HDMI-A-1, while the combined build puts DomK on
  HDMI-A-1 and DomU on HDMI-A-2. The SD image includes the Xen-aware DomK kernel
  and an 8 GiB `PARTLABEL=domk` AGL rootfs with Ankaios, Podman and `crun`.
- **`-a` (Android) = `--aaos=auto`**: how DomA is produced is chosen by `--aaos`
  (`off` | `auto` | `source` | `prebuilt`). **Nothing has to be staged by hand.**
  `--aaos=source` builds AAOS from public sources (measured: 5 h 11 min and 272 GiB of
  workspace on a 32-core host — see *Starting with no AOSP checkout* in `docs/BUILD.md`)
  and the DomA
  guest kernel, its vendor-boot ramdisk and the DomD-side gRPC backends are all
  derived or built from that; `--aaos=prebuilt --aaos-prebuilt=<dir>` consumes a
  bundle instead and skips the AOSP build (minutes). See *How the DomA artifacts are
  produced* (`docs/BUILD.md`).
- **Behind an HTTP(S) proxy / restricted network?** Set `HTTPS_PROXY` (that is the
  variable `build.sh` reads; `--proxy=<url>` does the same) and you will usually also
  need `CONNECTIVITY_CHECK_URIS=""` and `REPO_SKIP_SELF_UPDATE=1` (see *Docker
  usage*).
- **Proxy on the host's loopback (`127.0.0.1:3128`, `localhost`)?** A bridged container
  cannot reach it (its `127.0.0.1` is itself), and `build.sh` refuses to start rather than
  let `docker build` fail on `apt-get` with no mention of the proxy. Either point
  `--proxy` at the Docker bridge gateway (`docker network inspect bridge`, usually
  `http://172.17.0.1:3128`, if your proxy listens there too), set `XT_DOCKER_NETWORK=host`,
  or leave the proxy variables unset and let Docker's own client config
  (`~/.docker/config.json` → `proxies.default`) supply it -- an explicit value in the
  environment overrides that config. Details in *Docker usage* (`docs/BUILD.md`).
- To vary the build, run moulin/ninja by hand, or share an sstate cache, see
  *Build configuration*, *Docker usage* (`docs/BUILD.md`) and *Manual build* (`docs/BUILD.md`).

## System requirements
- **Docker** on the host — the build runs inside `docker/Dockerfile.builder`
  (rouge image assembly; no root, no loop devices). **[moulin](https://github.com/xen-troops/moulin)
  and ninja run *inside* that container**, so the host does not need them for the
  Docker path; install moulin on the host only for the *Manual build* (`docs/BUILD.md`) below.
- **git** and **bash** on the host — `build.sh` checks for git, initialises the
  `external/` submodules, and runs `meta-rpi-sodev/scripts/sync-guest-pins.sh`
  before entering any container.
- **Disk**: ~400 GiB free for a full `-a` (AAOS) build — one measured Android 17 run used 334 GiB
  of workspace plus a ~26 GiB SD image (~360 GiB), and AOSP dominates it; the
  guest-less default build (no AOSP) needs far less. Do not build on a
  filesystem with filename-length limits (e.g. ecryptfs).
- **RAM**: an AOSP/Yocto build is memory-hungry — for `-a` on Android 17, `soong_build`
  alone peaks at 42.6 GiB, so this tree is built with **64 GiB** and `--memory=48g`;
  32 GiB is not enough for `-a` (it is killed during soong analysis).
- Host is assumed Debian/Ubuntu (the Docker install links below are Ubuntu).

## Build configuration
`build.sh` drives moulin + ninja inside Docker. It takes V4H `build.sh`-style
flags (run `./build.sh -h`); the matching env vars are the fallback. **The
default build is Dom0(Zephyr) + DomD only — all application guests are opt-in.**
This matches upstream `sodev-demo-workspace` commit `f3f0f8f7`, which disables
the heavy Android/Flatcar guests by default.

| Flag (env var) | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `--board=<board>` (`BOARD`) | **rpi5** | Which board to build: `rpi5` or `rpi4`. Selects `<board>-sodev.yaml`, and with it the SoC, MACHINE, Zephyr Dom0 board, passthrough set, physical memory map and board layer (`meta-xt-rpi5` or `meta-xt-rpi4` — never both). Raspberry Pi 5 is the reference platform; see *meta-xt-rpi4/README.md* for what the Raspberry Pi 4 configuration is verified against |
| `--dom0=<os>` (`DOM0_OS`) | **zephyr** | Selects the entire Dom0 component body: Zephyr xenstore-only Dom0 (disaggregated; DomD owns the toolstack) or the thin Linux control Dom0 (classic; Dom0 owns xl). Both flavours are HW-verified on a real RPi5, at both `--ram` values; the Zephyr flavour is the shipping default. See the verification note in *Boot process* (`docs/DESIGN.md`). |
| `--ram=<sku>` (`BOARD_RAM`) | **16g** (rpi5) / **8g** (rpi4) | Board SKU; the valid values and the default depend on `--board`. **rpi5: `16g`\|`8g`.** `16g` = the full 4-domain map (Dom0 512 + DomD 4096 + DomU 1024 + DomA 4096 = 9728 MiB). `8g` takes **DomD to 3072 MiB** (static-mem bank4 at `0x180000000` dropped) **and DomA to 3072 MiB**; Dom0/DomU keep their sizes, so the four total 7680 MiB and fit an 8 GB board. Splitting the reduction is measured, not a preference — see *Board RAM size* (`docs/DESIGN.md`). **rpi4: `8g`\|`4g`.** `8g` = Dom0 128 (zephyr, the default) or 256 (linux) + DomD 1920 + DomU 1024 + DomA 2560; `4g` takes DomD to 1024 MiB (bank2 dropped, bank0 to 640 MiB) and DomA and DomU can no longer RUN at the same time — each fits alone, and `build.sh` says so |
| `-u`, `--domu` (`ENABLE_DOMU`) | **off** | Adds the AGL instrument-cluster DomU: Xen-aware kernel `linux-virtio-armv8` (p1) + AGL rootfs (p3). V4H-aligned minimal domu layer set (kernel via moulin; AGL rootfs via `build.sh`'s AGL bitbake) |
| `-a`, `--android` (`ENABLE_ANDROID`) | **off** | Include DomA (AAOS, p4 nested GPT). Alias for `--aaos=auto` — the mode chooses how DomA is produced |
| `-k`, `--ankaios` (`ENABLE_ANKAIOS`) | **off** | Adds the DomK Ankaios PoC. Requires `--board=rpi4 --ram=4g --dom0=zephyr`; supports DomK alone or DomK + DomU (`-k -u`) and rejects DomA. Builds the `agl-image-domk` AGL rootfs plus a Xen-aware kernel, installs the DomD-side `domk.cfg`/launch service and `ank` CLI, and adds an 8 GiB `domk` partition. DomK owns HDMI-A-1; in the combined build DomU uses HDMI-A-2. See [`docs/ANKAIOS-DOMK.md`](docs/ANKAIOS-DOMK.md) |
| `-z`, `--domz` (`ENABLE_DOMZ`) | **off** | Adds DomZ, the Zephyr RTOS domain: Zephyr built for its own Xen-guest board (`xenvm`, GICv2, Xen PV console) out of a second west workspace, staged on p1 as `zephyr-domz.bin` and started by the xl toolstack from `/etc/xen/domz.cfg`. 16 MiB / 1 vCPU, no rootfs and **no new partition**, so the p2/p3/p4 layout is unchanged. Console: `xl console DomZ`. See [`domz/README.md`](domz/README.md) |
| `--domains-only` (`NINJA_TARGET=""`) | off | Build the domains but skip SD-image assembly |
| `--aaos=<mode>` (`AAOS_MODE`) | off (`-a`⇒auto) | `off` \| `auto` \| `source` \| `prebuilt`. **auto** = prebuilt if a bundle is found (default probe `<workspace>/aaos-prebuilt-<board>`, then `<workspace>/aaos-prebuilt`), else source if an AOSP checkout is found, else off (or a hard error when DomA was required via `-a`) |
| `--aaos-prebuilt=<dir>` (`AAOS_PREBUILT_DIR`) | `<ws>/aaos-prebuilt-<board>`, then `<ws>/aaos-prebuilt` | Prebuilt AAOS bundle (`files/` + `images/` + `BUNDLE-INFO`, plus an optional `MANIFEST.md5`); consumed by `prebuilt`/`auto`. **Skips the AOSP source build entirely.** See *AAOS build modes* |
| (`AAOS_PREBUILT_ASSUME_BOARD`) | — | Accept a prebuilt bundle that has **no** `BUNDLE-INFO`, asserting -- unverified -- that it was built by this tree for this `--board`. A bundle without `BUNDLE-INFO` is otherwise refused; add the file instead (`board=`, `device=`, `android=`, `guest_kernel=`) |
| (`AAOS_GUEST_ANDROID`) / (`AAOS_GUEST_KERNEL`) | **17** / **6.18.32** | The DomA guest generation this tree builds and stages. A prebuilt bundle's `android=` / `guest_kernel=` are checked against them; the kernel version also names the staged kernel artifact (`aaos-android-kernel-xenbuilt-<ver>`, the recipe reads the same variable). Override only for a bundle whose p4 images were built against that other kernel |
| (`AAOS_KERNEL_MD5`) / (`AAOS_RAMDISK_MD5`) | — (no check) | Expected md5 of the staged DomA guest kernel / vendor-boot ramdisk. **Opt-in and off by default**: set them only to pin one validated prebuilt bundle, and a mismatch then fails the `aaos-guest-binaries` recipe. `build.sh` says so when a bundle ships no `MANIFEST.md5` |
| `--aaos-src=<dir>` (`AAOS_SRC_DIR`) | — | Reuse an existing AOSP checkout for `source` mode (skip the repo sync; still builds AOSP from it) |
| `--aaos-ref=<dir>` (`XT_AAOS_REF`) / `--aaos-kernel-ref=<dir>` (`XT_AAOS_KERNEL_REF`) | — | Repo **object mirrors** for the AOSP and AAOS-guest-kernel trees. `build.sh` seeds each checkout with `repo init --reference=<dir>` (manifest URL/rev/depth read from `rpi5-sodev.yaml`, so nothing is pinned twice) and moulin preserves the reference, so the syncs stay local. Accepts a repo client or a bare `*-project-objects` export. The AAOS analogue of `--west-cache` — see *Starting with no AOSP checkout* (`docs/BUILD.md`) |
| (`XT_AAOS_SYNC_JOBS`) | 4 | Parallelism of the **reference-mirror pre-sync** (only with `--aaos-ref`/`--aaos-kernel-ref`); raise it on a fast link, lower it behind a rate-limited proxy. The plain `source`-mode sync is moulin's own `repo` fetch and is not affected |
| (`XT_CACHE_MOUNTS`) | — | Extra `docker -v` mount specs (space-separated) bind-mounted into the builders, e.g. to share an sstate/downloads cache |
| `--rebuild-images` | off | Force-rebuild the `XT_DOCKER` image (`sodev-builder-rpi`). It never touches the V4H workspace's `sodev-builder` -- the two workspaces use different Dockerfiles and, since this series, different tags. Not needed for the Zephyr SDK 1.0.1 / python3.12 move that this series makes: the new tag has no pre-existing image, so the first build creates it already up to date. You need it only when `XT_DOCKER` points at an older image (a pre-rename `sodev-builder`, say), which fails the Zephyr build with `Could NOT find Python3: Found unsuitable version "3.10.12"` (Zephyr 4.4 sets `PYTHON_MINIMUM_REQUIRED 3.12`) |
| `--west-cache=<dir>` (`XT_WEST_CACHE_DIR`) | — | Point the Zephyr west fetches at a pre-populated reference workspace, so `west update` runs offline (the AAOS analogue is `--aaos-ref`). Used for both west workspaces: Dom0's and DomZ's |
| `--memory=<size>` (`XT_DOCKER_MEMORY`) | — (unlimited) | Cap each build container's RAM via docker `--memory` **and** `--memory-swap` (equal ⇒ no host-swap spill, so an unbounded moulin/AOSP/Yocto build cannot OOM the host), e.g. `24g` |
| (`XT_DOCKER_NETWORK`) | — (Docker bridge) | `--network` value for the build containers, e.g. `host`. Needed when the build has to reach a proxy or package mirror bound to the **host's** loopback: a bridged container's `127.0.0.1` is its own, not the host's. Applies to `docker run` and `docker build` -- the image build fetches packages too. **Only `host`, `none` and `default` work there**: BuildKit refuses `docker build --network=bridge` and named networks (rc=1, measured on docker 29.7.2), so reach those through `XT_DOCKER_RUN_OPTS` instead. `build.sh` refuses any other value at the point where it has to build the image, and names three ways on: build the image once with `host`, use `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0` (the classic builder does take a bridge and named networks), or move the network to `XT_DOCKER_RUN_OPTS` and clear this variable. With the image already present nothing is refused -- the value never reaches `docker build`. A `--network` in both places lands twice on the same `docker run`, which `build.sh` refuses up front |
| (`XT_DOCKER_RUN_OPTS`) | — | Extra `docker run` options applied verbatim to every builder, for anything `--memory` does not cover (e.g. `--cpus 8`) |
| (`XT_DOCKER_RUN_OPTS_AOSP`) | — | Extra `docker run` options for the **AOSP (DomA source) container only**, added on top of `XT_DOCKER_RUN_OPTS`. This is where the three nsjail `--security-opt ... unconfined` relaxations go (*0. Check the host* in `docs/BUILD.md`): the Yocto/Zephyr container must stay confined, or BitBake's user-namespace check fails on Ubuntu 24.04 hosts (`build.sh` refuses the global form there). On those hosts `apparmor=unconfined` does not rescue nsjail either -- use the confining `docker-nsjail-build` profile from `docs/BUILD.md`, or lower `kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns` for the build |
| (`XT_DOCKER`) | `sodev-builder-rpi` | Tag of the unified build image. Deliberately not `sodev-builder`, the tag the V4H `sodev-demo-workspace` uses: on a host that builds both, one shared name would let `--rebuild-images` here replace the V4H image |
| (`AGL_IMAGE`) / (`AGL_MACHINE`) | `agl-cluster-demo-flutter-guest` / `virtio-aarch64` | Image recipe and `MACHINE` for the DomU AGL build (`aglsetup.sh -m` then `bitbake`) |
| (`DOMK_AGL_IMAGE`) | `agl-image-domk` | AGL image recipe built for DomK when `-k` is enabled. Override only when supplying a compatible DomK image recipe from the same configured AGL layers |
| (`AGL_DOCKER`) | `$XT_DOCKER` | Image for the DomU AGL bitbake. Follows `XT_DOCKER`; set it to the AGL-official `docker-worker` to use that instead (then `docker pull` it yourself -- `build.sh` builds only its own tag) |
| `--sstate=<dir>` (`XT_SSTATE_DIR`) | — | Reuse an external Yocto sstate cache; bind-mounted into the builders Must name an **existing** directory (a typo would otherwise rebuild everything against an empty cache); an existing but empty one is accepted with a note. |
| `--dl=<dir>` (`XT_DL_DIR`) | — | Reuse an external Yocto downloads dir; bind-mounted into the builders Must name an existing directory, as `--sstate`. |
| (`BB_HASHSERVE`) | — (bitbake `auto`: a private server per build) | Hash-equivalence server for **every** bitbake in this build -- the moulin Yocto domains and the DomU AGL bitbake alike (both containers get the variable) -- so equivalent tasks are reused across workspaces and machines: `unix:///path/to/hashserve.sock` (bind-mount the socket's directory with `XT_CACHE_MOUNTS`) or `host:port` (reachable from the container's network). Passed through to bitbake as-is; bitbake already excludes it from task hashes |

DomU / DomA gating follows the V4H `prod-devel-rcar4_new.yaml` idiom: the
`meta-xt-doma` layer is always in `bblayers`, and `ENABLE_ANDROID=no` masks all
its recipes via `BBMASK` (`XT_DOMA_BBMASK`), so a guest-less build never parses
the AAOS-prebuilt SRC_URI and never references an unbuildable provider. See the
in-file comments of `rpi5-sodev.yaml` (the authoritative documentation).

DomK is a separate RPi4 PoC gate. `build.sh` validates its board, RAM, Dom0 and
DomA exclusions before entering Docker, builds the AGL rootfs with the pinned
Scarthgap `meta-ankaios` layer, and passes `ENABLE_ANKAIOS=yes` to moulin. The
complete implementation and current validation status are in
[`docs/ANKAIOS-DOMK.md`](docs/ANKAIOS-DOMK.md).

## Build — details & options
The *Quick start* above is the happy path (`./build.sh` → `full.img`); *Build
configuration* lists the flags/flavours. This section covers the Docker build
environment, running moulin + ninja by hand, and staging the AAOS prebuilts for
`-a`.

The Yocto domains — DomD, the thin Linux Dom0 flavour and the DomU kernel — generate an SPDX 3.0.1
SBOM: poky enables `create-spdx` by default (`INHERIT_DISTRO` in `defaultsetup.conf`) and this
workspace keeps it on. Each domain writes its documents to `tmp/deploy/spdx/3.0.1/` in that build
directory, plus a per-image SBOM beside the image. They are deploy artifacts and are never part of a
rootfs. The DomU AGL rootfs is a separate bitbake with its own poky and emits SPDX 2.2. If a local
build ever needs the SBOM off, add `INHERIT:remove = "create-spdx"` to that build's `conf/local.conf`
and run bitbake inside the builder. Note the two builds differ in how long that edit lives: `build.sh`
deletes and regenerates `yocto/build-dom*/conf` on every run, so an edit there is gone next run, while
`agl/build/conf/local.conf` keeps it: `aglsetup.sh` skips configuration generation altogether once a
`conf/local.conf` is there, and only `-f` overwrites it.

## Flashing the SD card
```sh
sudo dd if=full.img of=/dev/<sd-dev> bs=4M conv=fsync status=progress
```
**NOTE:** Be sure to identify `<sd-dev>` correctly. To identify the SD card,
plug/unplug it and check `/dev/` for devices that were added/removed.

**NOTE:** If auto-mount is enabled, make sure any existing SD-card partitions
are unmounted before writing.

The image is GPT: a FAT boot partition (RPi firmware, u-boot + `boot.scr`, Xen,
Zephyr Dom0 binary, domain kernels/initramfs, device trees and guest boot
payloads), rootfs partitions for the Linux domains, and — when
`ENABLE_ANDROID=yes` — an Android partition (`PARTLABEL=android`, nested GPT
assembled the V4H way from the `doma`/`doma_kernel` moulin components).

## Hardware & displays
- Raspberry Pi 5 (BCM2712 + RP1) — the reference platform. Both the **16 GB** and the
  **8 GB** SKU are supported; `--ram=16g|8g` selects which (16g is the default). The
  full 4-domain build comes to 9728 MiB on 16g and 7680 MiB on 8g — see *Board RAM size*
  (`docs/DESIGN.md`). Official 27 W (5 A) PSU required — 3 A supplies negotiate low
  current and corrupt the HDMI scanout.
- Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (BCM2711), via `--board=rpi4`. **8 GB** and **4 GB** SKUs;
  four domains need the 8 GB board. Every USB-A port is behind the VL805 xHCI, so the
  touch panel depends on passing that controller through. What is and is not verified on
  this board, and the open items, are listed in
  `meta-rpi-sodev/meta-xt-rpi4/README.md`.
- HDMI-A-1: 1920x720 cluster panel (forced CVT modeline — its EDID does not come through).
- HDMI-A-2: 1920x720 IVI panel (forced modeline transcribed from its EDID). This panel
  answers the EDID read **3.7 s late**, which used to leave it dark for the whole
  session; weston's start is held until the DRM mode lists settle. See *Late EDID on
  HDMI-A-2* below.
- Native USB touch on the IVI panel (RP1 passthrough + virtio-tablet forward).

| Hypervisor | **Xen 4.22.0 — interim local `xen_4.22.bb`** (meta-virtualization master at `526c9725` stops at 4.21; the copy lives in `meta-xt-common/meta-xt-domx` so both board products see it, and is to be submitted upstream and deleted once accepted) + an ordered patch series in the shared `recipes-extended/xen-common` recipe (29 `.patch` files, required by both Dom0 flavours' Xen bbappends) plus the `0025` dom0less static-mem xenstore-page patch, which each board layer carries a copy of and both apply (**30 applied on rpi5, 29 on rpi4** -- that board excludes `4.22-0002`, which routes the BCM2712 MIP MSI it has no equivalent of; the exclusion and its reasoning are in `meta-xt-rpi4`'s bbappend). Of the 29, **23 come from the xen-troops fork** — 14 carried verbatim and 9 (`0004`, `0008`, `0010`, `0013`, `0016`, `0018`, `0019`, `0022`, `0024`) with local modifications declared on a `Local-Modifications:` line — and **6 are authored here** (`4.22-000{1..6}`). Moving 4.21 → 4.22 left 25 of the 29 untouched: `0008`/`0018` were regenerated against stable-4.22 (context drift only, emitted code identical) and `0022`/`4.22-0001` were rebased, each recording it on its `Local-Modifications:` line. The fork-derived patches keep their original authors and carry `Upstream-Status: Inappropriate` with an `Origin:` line naming the fork commit, because xen-troops is a downstream fork and not the upstream of Xen. The six authored here are build-verified (compile+link clean on arm64 Xen 4.22.0); three carry `Upstream-Status: Pending` (`0002`, `0005`, `0006` -- `0006` is the 4.22 dom0less phandle regression fix this series exists on top of, measured on hardware) and three carry `Upstream-Status: Inappropriate` because they are deliberately downstream: `0001` is the RPi5/BCM2712 working delta, `0003` reverts upstream hardening `2fbd7e609e` to re-permit bufioreq on Arm for this virtio-heavy configuration -- a security relaxation for the demo, not for upstream -- and `0004` locks a field that only the fork's legacy-PCI series (`0013`/`0019`) creates, so it cannot be submitted as-is |
| Virtualization layer | **meta-virtualization, pinned** (`781735b9`) — fetched by moulin at build time, not vendored. It supplies `xen.inc`/`xen-hypervisor.inc`/`xen-tools.inc` but **not** a 4.22 version recipe, so `xen_4.22.bb` / `xen-tools_4.22.bb` (PV `4.22.0+stable` / `4.22+stable`, xenbits `stable-4.22` @ `d45d5687f1`) are carried locally in `meta-xt-common/meta-xt-domx` and selected via `PREFERRED_VERSION_xen` / `PREFERRED_VERSION_xen-tools`. Both are interim, pending upstream acceptance |
| Dom0 (zephyr) | Zephyr xenstore server (patch series under `meta-rpi-sodev/meta-xt-common/meta-xt-dom0-zephyr/`, applied on the upstream Zephyr Dom0 tree) |
| Dom0 (linux) / DomD kernel | Linux 6.18.33 (`linux-raspberrypi`) |
| DomD graphics | Mesa 26.0.5, weston 15.0.0 (kiosk-shell), libdrm 2.4.131 |
| DomD device-model | QEMU 7.0.0 (Xen IOREQ, virtio-gpu-gl, vhost-net/-vsock) |
| DomU guest | AGL SoDeV instrument cluster (`agl-cluster-demo-flutter-guest`, kernel 6.8.0-rc1 — historically aligned with the V4H AGL SoDeV DomU kernel: torvalds linux `6613476e` + the single Xen backend-domid patch, plus the RPi5-specific `xen-force-grant.cfg`; the current V4H submodule has since moved to a 6.12-series DomU kernel; MACHINE virtio-aarch64) |
| DomA guest | AAOS (`aosp_xenvm_trout_rpi5_arm64` / `aosp_xenvm_trout_rpi4_arm64`), Xen virtio (CONFIG_XEN / XEN_VIRTIO). The virtio contract is the V4H one: a complete V4H-built AAOS image (kernel, ramdisk and p4 from one build) boots unmodified -- measured in 2026-07 with a V4H Android 17 image on this stack while it was still Android 15. `build.sh` nevertheless accepts only prebuilt bundles that declare this tree's own generation (Android 17 / GKI 6.18.32, `BUNDLE-INFO`): the failure it guards against is a *mixed* set, a guest kernel and a `vendor_dlkm` from different builds, which share no `module_layout` and boot to a black panel |
| DomK guest | RPi4 4 GiB PoC: AGL `agl-image-domk`, Eclipse Ankaios 1.0.3 server/agent and `ank`, Podman 5.0.1 with `crun` 1.14.3, Weston and Xen virtio devices. See [`docs/ANKAIOS-DOMK.md`](docs/ANKAIOS-DOMK.md) |
| DomZ guest | Zephyr 4.4.1 (the same manifest and pins as Dom0 — its own west workspace, brought to 4.4.1 by `apply-zephyr-patches.sh --manifest-only`), board `xenvm` (GICv2, Xen PV console), Zephyr SDK 1.0.1 / `aarch64-zephyr-elf`. Application in [`domz/`](domz/README.md) |

## Zephyr Dom0 (DOM0_OS=zephyr, the default)

Moved to [`docs/DESIGN.md`](docs/DESIGN.md) — what the default Dom0 does and does not do.

## Boot process

Moved to [`docs/DESIGN.md`](docs/DESIGN.md) — the order the four domains come up in, per flavour.

## Differences vs the V4H AGL SoDeV (`sodev-demo-workspace`)

Moved to [`docs/DESIGN.md`](docs/DESIGN.md) — what this port changed relative to the R-Car V4H reference.

## Testing / console access
| Target | Access |
|---|---|
| Dom0 (zephyr) | UART: the RPi5 debug UART is muxed — press `Ctrl-A` three times to cycle consoles; Zephyr shell (`xu list`, `xu console <id>`) |
| Dom0 (linux) | **UART**: physical debug UART — press `Ctrl-A` three times to cycle input to `DOM0` (Linux login). **SSH**: Dom0 sits on the private point-to-point link `192.168.0.1` (the DomD netfront is deliberately *not* bridged into the flat segment — bridging wedges DomD's xenbus). `sshd` is socket-activated. Reach it from the bench PC via DomD's IP forwarding: `sudo ip route add 192.168.0.0/24 via 192.168.10.10 && ssh root@192.168.0.1` |
| DomD | **SSH** (primary): `ssh root@192.168.10.10` — DomD runs the toolstack, so `xl list` / `xl console <domU/domA>` run from here. **UART**: DomD is a dom0less **vpl011** domain (console → hypervisor ring), so `xl console 1` / `xu console 1` cannot attach it (no PV console ring/evtchn is allocated for dom0less vpl011). On the debug UART press `Ctrl-A` three times to cycle input to `DOM1` (`raspberrypi5-domd login:`); or read its log with `xl dmesg \| grep DOM1`. |
| DomU (AGL) | `ssh root@192.168.10.12`; or `xl console 3` from the toolstack domain (`domu login:`) |
| DomK (Ankaios PoC) | From DomD, use `xl console DomK` for the `hvc0` console. DomK uses `192.168.10.15`; the DomD-side `ank` CLI connects to the Ankaios server there. See [`docs/ANKAIOS-DOMK.md`](docs/ANKAIOS-DOMK.md) for the workload update demonstration |
| DomZ (Zephyr) | **`xl console DomZ`** from the toolstack domain (DomD in the zephyr flavour, Dom0 in the linux one) — Zephyr's Xen **PV console**, which is why the `xenvm` board is used rather than a vpl011 dom0less domain. `xenconsole` needs a tty, so over ssh use `ssh -tt root@192.168.10.10 'xl console DomZ'`. No network, no display: this console is the only interface. Exit with `Ctrl-]` |
| DomA (AAOS) | `adb connect 192.168.10.13:5555` (Android has no sshd); `adb logcat` for logcat. Serial console: **`xl console 2`** from the toolstack domain — DomA's `hvc0` is the Xen **PV console**, and AAOS init's `console` service puts a shell on it (prompt `console:/ $`, uid 2000 `shell`). `xenconsole` calls `tcsetattr()` on stdin, so it needs a tty: over ssh use `ssh -tt root@192.168.10.10 'xl console 2'`. The `virtconsole` sockets in `doma.cfg` are **inert** — see the note below. |

## Build & hardware verification (RPi5)
**Both Dom0 flavours build end-to-end** from a clean checkout to a complete,
loopback-verified 4-domain SD image: the single `sodev-builder-rpi` image produces
`full.img` with the four-partition GPT (p1 boot carrying the flavour's Dom0
payload — `zephyr.bin` or the thin-Linux Dom0 initramfs, p2/p3 ext4 domain
rootfs, p4 the AAOS 12-partition nested GPT), verified for both `--dom0=zephyr`
and `--dom0=linux`.

On **hardware**, the default **Zephyr-Dom0** disaggregated stack is verified
(dual display, guest create from DomD's toolstack, the *Health checks* (`docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`) above):
the AGL cluster renders on HDMI-A-1 and the shipping **`--aaos=prebuilt` AAOS**
renders on HDMI-A-2 (all guest modules load, SurfaceFlinger up) — the guest
kernel and the `super.img` vendor_dlkm modules must come from one coherent build
(same `module_layout` ABI; see *How the DomA artifacts are produced* (`docs/BUILD.md`)). The **thin Linux-Dom0** flavour
has since been booted end to end on both boards on this tree (P2 and P3 below).
The Zephyr full-image HW checklist. **[4.22] The list below was first measured on Xen
4.21.** On **Xen 4.22** the four verification patterns of this tree were run on hardware
on 2026-08-18 and all passed -- RPi4 and RPi5 x Zephyr-Dom0 and thin-Linux-Dom0 -- with
`xu list` answering in the Zephyr-Dom0 flavour, which is the one place a missed
domctl-ABI bump would show. What that campaign did **not** re-measure, and is therefore
still open: the dual display was confirmed only as configuration (both connectors
`connected`, weston defining two outputs), **adb over TCP could not be reached on the
RPi5 guest**, and touch input was not exercised. The per-item list:
- Xen 4.21 boots (0 panics); all 4 domains auto-start; qemu device-models auto-spawn.
- Dual display + native touch, no scanout artifacts.
- SSH from the PC to DomD/DomU, adb to DomA; consoles for all domains.
- DomA management IP (192.168.10.13) via dnsmasq static lease — no manual step.
- Full 4-domain + hypervisor log audit performed; the actionable items are
  fixed in-tree (legacy Dom0 qdisk unit masked; prebuilt dumpstate backend not
  auto-enabled until rebuilt against wrynose libxml2).

As a portability proof, the **V4H-built DomA image boots unmodified** on this stack
(guest kernel/ramdisk/super swapped as binaries — no rebuild). Measured in 2026-07 with a
complete V4H Android 17 set on this stack while it was still Android 15, so the virtio
contract (virtio-pci, virtio-gpu-gl) carries across guest generations. What does not is a
*mixed* set: a guest kernel and a `vendor_dlkm` from different builds share no
`module_layout`, and the guest never reaches SurfaceFlinger. `build.sh` therefore
accepts only prebuilt bundles that declare this tree's generation (`BUNDLE-INFO`
`android=` / `guest_kernel=`: Android 17 / GKI 6.18.32); a coherent image of another
generation is outside what this tree verifies, not something it has been shown to break.

**DomZ (`-z`) is verified on hardware in all four verification patterns** (RPi4 and
RPi5, Zephyr-Dom0 and thin-Linux-Dom0): `xl list` shows the domain at 16 MiB / 1 vCPU,
`xl console DomZ` prints `DomZ up: Zephyr 4.4.1 as Xen DomU (AGL SoDeV)` and the
heartbeat, and the interval measured 10 s with no missed ticks. The unit that creates it
lands in the toolstack domain of either flavour (DomD for Zephyr-Dom0, the thin Dom0 for
the Linux one) and is `active` in both.

On a PC, before that:

- the moulin graph resolves for every flag combination (`-z`, both Dom0 flavours, with
  and without `-u`/`-a`, both `--ram` values) and `ninja image-full` has a rule for
  every artifact;
- the DomZ image builds through the real path (`moulin` + `ninja domz`, second west
  workspace, Zephyr SDK 1.0.1) for the `xenvm` board -- 304 KB of the domain's 16 MiB
  (1.86%; the figure is Zephyr's own RAM report, not the size of zephyr.bin, which is
  44 KB);
- bitbake parses the whole layer set with the new layer in it (3350 recipes, 0 errors)
  and builds `xt-xen-cfg-domz`;
- **the whole SD image builds end to end** (`./build.sh -z` -> `full.img`) and its
  contents check out without root or loop devices: p1 (FAT) carries `zephyr-domz.bin`
  byte-identical to the built artifact (same md5), and the DomD rootfs that becomes p2
  carries `/etc/xen/domz.cfg`, `/usr/lib/systemd/system/xl-create-domz.service` and the
  `multi-user.target.wants` symlink that auto-enables it;
- **DomZ was created and booted under QEMU first** -- aarch64 with Xen 4.21.1-pre and a
  minimal Linux Dom0 (`domz/tools/qemu-xen-domz.sh`): `xl create` accepted the image,
  `xl list` showed `DomZ ... -b----` (idle, i.e. healthy) and `xl console DomZ` printed
  the banner (that run predates the move to 4.4.1). The image format holds for the
  reason libxc's loaders say it should: Zephyr's arm64 output carries a Linux arm64
  Image header (`"ARM\x64"` at offset 0x38), which `xc_dom_probe_zimage64_kernel()`
  claims (the multiboot `bin` loader would have rejected a bare blob).

The bring-up order and how to iterate over `scp` **without reflashing the SD card** are
in [`domz/README.md`](domz/README.md); the failure signatures are in *DomZ does not
start* (`docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`).

## Known issues

Moved to [`docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) — symptom -> cause -> what to do, with the logs each was diagnosed from.

## DomD compositor startup and rootfs (V4H-aligned)

Moved to [`docs/DESIGN.md`](docs/DESIGN.md) — why weston is a systemd unit and why the DomD rootfs is SD p2.

## Security note (review before deploying outside a closed lab)
The image sets dev-convenience IMAGE_FEATURES (`empty-root-password`,
`allow-empty-password`, `allow-root-login`; a debug-tweaks-equivalent posture) and
lab RFC1918 addresses in the network configs. No private keys or
credentials are committed (SSH host keys are generated on device, not shipped).
This posture is a deliberate lab/demo configuration matching the AGL
`agl-devel` feature and the V4H SoDeV reference implementation it derives from;
it is not intended for production. Harden these (real root credentials,
`PermitRootLogin no`, no empty passwords) before any non-lab deployment.

Two further lab-only interfaces are worth calling out explicitly, because they are
not password-protected at all:

- **qemu monitor.** `doma.cfg` and `domu.cfg` each expose a qemu HMP monitor on a
  loopback TCP port (`-monitor telnet:127.0.0.1:<port>,server,nowait`). Anything that
  can reach DomD's loopback has full control of that guest's device model, including
  the ability to terminate it. Bind it to a permission-restricted unix socket, or
  remove it, before any non-lab deployment.
- **DomA console.** `doma.cfg` exposes six `virtconsole` backends as unauthenticated
  UNIX sockets in DomD (`/run/android_vm_virtconsole*`). They currently carry no data
  (the Xen PV console takes `hvc0` first — see *Serial console* (`docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`) above), so they are not
  a live exposure today, but nothing authenticates a connection and the intended
  mapping was an in-guest shell. Remove them, or move them to a permission-restricted
  path, before any non-lab deployment. Note that DomA's actual shell — `xl console 2`,
  prompt `console:/ $` — is reachable by anything that can run the toolstack in DomD,
  and `adb` is open on `192.168.10.13:5555` with no authentication.

`xen,static-mem`-related hypervisor hardening is also relaxed for the demo: the
`4.22-0003` patch reverts an upstream restriction on buffered ioreq for Arm so the
DomD device model can serve the guests. That revert is deliberate and is documented in
the patch header; it should not be carried into a production hypervisor.
