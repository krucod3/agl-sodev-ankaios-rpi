#
# A single image for the whole workspace. It reconstructs the EPAM/xen-troops
# moulin/ninja build environment and folds in the AOSP host toolchain and the
# AGL bitbake host deps so one container can run every heavy build step:
# moulin + ninja (Dom0/DomD Yocto + Xen + Zephyr), the AOSP/AAOS (DomA) build,
# and the DomU AGL bitbake.
# V4H AGL SoDeV ships no moulin Dockerfile (it builds on the host); this image
# is the RPi5 project's docker-first equivalent (all-heavy-builds-in-docker),
# pinned to a known-good moulin revision.
#
# NOTE: the DomU AGL build historically ran in the AGL-official docker-worker
# (Ubuntu 20.04). AGL (scarthgap) bitbake host requirements are a subset of the
# Yocto host deps below and build on Ubuntu 22.04; to use the AGL-official image
# instead, pass AGL_DOCKER=<official-image> ./build.sh.
#
# Contents:
#   - moulin 0.28 (git pin) + ninja + west     -> orchestrator / Zephyr meta-tool
#   - Yocto (wrynose/scarthgap) host deps       -> Dom0/DomD + DomU AGL bitbake
#   - rouge image-builder deps                  -> userspace SD-image assembly
#       mtools/dosfstools (FAT), e2fsprogs (ext4), gpt-image (pure-python GPT),
#       android-sdk-libsparse-utils (simg2img) -> rouge's android_sparse writer.
#   - AOSP host toolchain (repo/bazel/JDK17 +   -> DomA (AAOS) build, run by the
#       multilib/ncurses/squashfs/... per          moulin `android` builder under
#       source.android.com host requirements)      ninja (repo sync + lunch + build).
#   - Zephyr SDK 1.0.1 (aarch64-zephyr-elf)     -> Zephyr Dom0 (DOM0_OS=zephyr).
#   - Python 3.12 (deadsnakes) + a 3.12 `west`  -> Zephyr 4.4 requires >= 3.12
#       (cmake/modules/python.cmake). The Yocto/AOSP side keeps the distro
#       python3 (3.10); see the Python 3.12 layer below for why both exist.

# Python 3.12 for the Zephyr build only.
#
# Zephyr 4.4 sets PYTHON_MINIMUM_REQUIRED 3.12 (cmake/modules/python.cmake) and
# Ubuntu 22.04 ships 3.10, so the Zephyr Dom0 build cannot use the distro python3.
# Yocto (wrynose/scarthgap) and the AOSP host tools, on the other hand, are only
# validated against the distro python3 here — so this does NOT replace python3;
# 3.12 is installed alongside it.
#
# The hand-off is `west`: python.cmake takes Python3_EXECUTABLE from WEST_PYTHON
# when it is not set explicitly, and `west build` passes the interpreter it is
# itself running under. Pointing /usr/local/bin/west at the 3.12 venv is therefore
# all it takes to move the whole Zephyr build onto 3.12. Nothing else changes:
# python3 and pip3 stay 3.10 and PATH is untouched. moulin DOES drive west (its
# zephyr builder runs `west build`), but it launches it as a subprocess and never
# imports it, so replacing west's interpreter is invisible to moulin and bitbake.
# Cost note: software-properties-common is only here for add-apt-repository, and it
# drags in ~50 packages (packagekit, polkit, gstreamer, appstream, gir bindings).
# They are inert in a build container - nothing runs as a daemon - but if the image
# size matters, replace this with a hand-written /etc/apt/sources.list.d entry plus
# the deadsnakes signing key and drop software-properties-common. Verified either
# way that no pre-existing package is removed or downgraded by this layer.

# Zephyr's scripts/requirements-base.txt, in a 3.12 virtualenv.
#
# The venv is not optional. deadsnakes' python3.12 keeps /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages
# on its sys.path, i.e. it shares the *distro* package directory with python3.10.
# A plain `python3.12 -m pip install PyYAML` therefore finds the apt-installed
# PyYAML 5.4.1 there, uninstalls it, and writes 6.x into 3.12's own dist-packages —
# which silently removes yaml from python3.10 and breaks moulin
# ("ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'yaml'"). Observed, not hypothetical.
#
# Symlinking the venv's west over /usr/local/bin/west is the hand-off: `west build`
# reports its own interpreter as WEST_PYTHON, python.cmake adopts that as
# Python3_EXECUTABLE, and the venv is where Zephyr's python deps live. moulin and
# bitbake keep using the distro python3, untouched.
#
# --retry rides out a flaky proxy. Kept as a LATE layer so it never invalidates the
# moulin git-install cache above.
