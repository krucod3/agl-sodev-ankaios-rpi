SUMMARY = "DomD VC4 graphics driver domain image for RPi5 + Xen"
DESCRIPTION = "Linux DomD image for the disaggregated cockpit. DomD owns vc4-drm \
(V3D + HVS + HDMI + mailbox) and runs weston, started by the stock systemd \
weston.service as on the V4H reference implementation, as the sole graphics \
compositor with the gl-renderer / Mesa V3D path. Hosts the thin \
qemu-system-aarch64 device-model (spawned by xl devd) for DomU/DomA virtio-pci \
surface compositing onto HDMI. \
\
This ext4 image is the SHIPPING DomD rootfs: it is written to SD p2 and mounted \
directly by the dom0less DomD (root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 in the zephyr flavour, or \
root=/dev/xvda over PV-block in the linux flavour, where Dom0 owns the SD). The \
older RAM-initramfs boot path is available in the git history if a RAM-root \
the tree for recovery but is no longer part of the boot flow."

# DomU surface compositing.
#   - The full `qemu` meta-package is not installed: DomD only needs the thin
#     qemu-system-aarch64 (installed by rpi5-image-xt-domd-v4h.bb), which has
#     the virtio-gpu qdisk/block backend built in. The device-model is spawned
#     by xl devd (xendriverdomain).
#   - virglrenderer is required for virtio-gpu-gl rendering, so it is kept.
#   - The shipping compositor uses weston's kiosk-shell (app-id output routing,
#     see weston.ini); the ivi-shell stack (wayland-ivi-extension + DisplayManager)
#     was an earlier, never-completed prototype and is not installed.

# Driver-domain runtime that used to live only in the RAM initramfs image.
# Now that this ext4 image IS the DomD rootfs, everything the running driver
# domain needs has to be here:
#   - xen-network-flatbridge : the SSH-reachability design (flat L2 bridge,
#                              domd-sshd-fix, static eth0). xen-network alone
#                              only carries the base network units.
#   - domd-toolstack-prep    : seeds the Zephyr xenstore (cpupool name,
#                              xenconsoled domid), creates /var/lib/xen and
#                              /var/log/xen/console and runs the console seeder.
#                              xl-create-doma/domu.service have
#                              Requires=domd-toolstack-prep.service.
#   - dnsmasq / socat        : DomA DHCP lease and DomA console relay.
#   - haveged                : the A76 has no hwrng / FEAT_RNG, so early
#                              getrandom would block `ssh-keygen -A`; this
#                              jitter-entropy daemon seeds the CRNG quickly.
#   - bash                   : the qemu wrapper installed below is #!/bin/bash.
#   - libsdl2                : qemu -display sdl,gl=on.
#   - rp1-touch-bridge       : forwards the RP1 touch controller to the guests.
#   - kernel-module-bridge   : xenbr0 (CONFIG_BRIDGE=m).
#   - kernel-module-pwm-fan  : cooling-device of the cpu_thermal zone.
#   - openssh-sftp-server    : scp/sftp onto DomD.
#   - logrotate              : /var/log and /var/log/xen are persistent now (see
#                              install_persistent_var_log), so they need rotating.

# In the thin-Linux flavour the toolstack is DOM0's, not DomD's: Dom0 runs xenstored,
# attaches the guest disks (xl-attach-disks.service) and creates DomU/DomA itself. The
# three DomD-side units below therefore have no job, and leaving them enabled is not
# harmless in either direction:
#
#   * domd-toolstack-prep seeds a Zephyr xenstore that does not exist here. Measured on
#     hardware 2026-08-03: it failed, was restarted five times, then gave up
#     ("Start request repeated too quickly"), filling the Xen console with
#     `(XEN) DOM1: [FAILED] Failed to start DomD toolstack preparation for the
#     Zephyr-Dom0 topology` and `[DEPEND] Dependency failed for Launch DomU/DomA`.
#   * the DEPEND failures are what kept DomD's own xl-create-{domu,doma} from running,
#     which is the ONLY reason the boot came up correctly. Satisfying the requirement
#     instead -- e.g. with the no-op stub meta-xt-dom0-linux ships into the DOM0 rootfs
#     for exactly this reason -- would let DomD race Dom0 to create the same domains.
#
# So mask all three rather than stub them: masked units neither fail nor run. The units
# stay installed (the image content is flavour-independent); only the enablement changes,
# which is the same approach used for the serial-getty units above.
# Which Dom0 the image is being built alongside. The default MUST match the moulin
# default: without it an unset DOM0_OS expands to the empty string, which is not
# "zephyr", and the masks below would fire on a standalone `bitbake
# rpi5-image-xt-domd-vc4` -- silently shipping a DomD that never creates the guests
# in the flavour where it is supposed to. Same default as xt-rpi-u-boot-scr.bbappend.
