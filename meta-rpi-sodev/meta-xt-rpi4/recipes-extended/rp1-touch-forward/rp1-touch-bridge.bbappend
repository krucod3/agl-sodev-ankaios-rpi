# Route the touch panel to HDMI-A-1 on this board, not HDMI-A-2.
#
# WHY
# 72-rp1-touch-output.rules tags every touchscreen interface WL_OUTPUT=HDMI-A-2 because
# on the reference board AAOS/DomA lives on that output. On THIS RPi4 only HDMI-A-1 has a
# panel attached -- /sys/class/drm reads
#     card0-HDMI-A-1: connected 1920x720
#     card0-HDMI-A-2: disconnected
# -- so whichever guest owns the panel is put on HDMI-A-1 in weston.ini (DomU by default;
# DomA when ENABLE_ANDROID=yes moves it there -- see RPI4_PANEL_GUEST in
# meta-xt-rpi4/recipes-graphics/wayland/weston-init.bbappend). WL_OUTPUT names the OUTPUT,
# not the guest, so HDMI-A-1 is right under either setting and this bbappend needs no gate
# of its own. The touch routing has to follow the panel, and it is NOT enough to leave it
# pointing at a dead output:
# weston does not fall back to the primary output when WL_OUTPUT names one that does not
# exist. weston-15.0.0 libweston/libinput-seat.c:128-138
#
#     output_name = libinput_device_get_output_name(libinput_device);
#     if (output_name) {
#         device->output_name = strdup(output_name);
#         output = output_find_by_head_name(c, output_name);   /* NULL if disconnected */
#         evdev_device_set_output(device, output);
#     } else if (!wl_list_empty(&c->output_list)) {
#         /* default assignment to an arbitrary output */      /* <- only when UNSET */
#
# takes the "arbitrary output" branch ONLY when the property is unset, and
# libweston/libinput-device.c:460 then drops every event:
#
#     if (!device->output)
#             return;
#
# So WL_OUTPUT=HDMI-A-2 on a board where HDMI-A-2 is disconnected means touch is discarded
# inside weston -- the guest sees nothing, no matter which output its surface is on. That
# is the observed symptom (display works, touch does not).
#
# WHY A BBAPPEND
# meta-xt-common is kept byte-identical to upstream in this port, so the board-specific
# output map lives here. The LIBINPUT_IGNORE_DEVICE rules for the panel's second
# REL/mouse interface and the USB force-enumerate rules are board-independent and are
# left untouched.
#
# FILE NAME: rp1-touch-bridge.bbappend, NOT rp1-touch-bridge_%.bbappend. The recipe is
# rp1-touch-bridge.bb with no version in the filename, and `_%` requires an underscore to
# match -- with the wrong name bitbake does not ignore it, it FAILS the whole parse:
#     ERROR: No recipes in default available for: .../rp1-touch-bridge_%.bbappend
#
# IF THE CABLE MOVES to the second micro-HDMI port, drop this bbappend and revert
# weston.ini together -- the two must always name the same output.
