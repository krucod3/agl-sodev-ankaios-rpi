# 1. weston's seat must be bound to the VT its own unit declares (tty7).
#    Full rationale in files/96-vt-bind.conf. Without it the compositor is one
#    `chvt` away from a permanently black panel, which takes DomU's video with it.
#    chvt comes from kbd (busybox also ships one; /usr/bin/chvt is the
#    update-alternatives link, so either provider satisfies the path). kbd is
#    already in the DomD image; the RDEPENDS makes that a requirement instead of a
#    coincidence, because the drop-in silently degrades to "unit fails to start" if
#    the binary disappears.

# 2. RPi4 board wiring fix: the 1920x720 panel is on micro-HDMI 1, not micro-HDMI 2.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# meta-xt-driver-domain's weston.ini pins an explicit modeline per output and says so
# for good reason -- `mode=<WxH>` fails silently to a fallback when the mode is not yet
# in the connector list. Its two modelines encode the V4H/RPi5 bench wiring:
#
#   [output] HDMI-A-1   mode=111.75 1920 2016 2208 2496 720 723 733 748 -hsync +vsync
#            "HDMI-A-1 has no EDID at all", so this is `cvt 1920 720 60` output.
#   [output] HDMI-A-2   mode=93.24  1920 1968 2010 2100 720 723 733 740 +hsync +vsync
#            the panel's own preferred DTD, transcribed from its EDID (PNP RTD,
#            model "12.3FHD").
#
# On this RPi4 bench the SAME "12.3FHD" panel is plugged into micro-HDMI 1. Measured
# on hardware with modetest (2026-08-04):
#
#   35 34 connected HDMI-A-1
#     #0 1920x720 60.00 1920 1968 2010 2100 720 723 733 740 93240 phsync pvsync
#        type: preferred, driver
#   EDID: ... 00 fc 00 31 32 2e 33 46 48 44   ("12.3FHD")
#
# i.e. HDMI-A-1 DOES have an EDID here, and its preferred timing is the 93.24 MHz one
# the upstream file assigns to HDMI-A-2. Forcing the 111.75 MHz CVT timing onto a
# fixed-timing panel makes every atomic commit fail:
#
#   weston[555]: atomic: couldn't commit new state: Invalid argument
#   weston[555]: repaint-flush failed: No such file or directory
#
# repeated forever, so weston never presents a frame and the CRTC keeps scanning out
# fbcon's framebuffer -- the panel shows the DomD text console. Confirmed by
# /sys/kernel/debug/dri/1/state reporting `allocated by = [fbcon]` while weston was
# active, and fixed by this sed: after it, the same file reports `allocated by =
# weston` (XR24, 1920x720), the EINVAL storm stops, and weston-flower was VISIBLE on
# the panel (verified with a webcam, 2026-08-04).
#
# Only HDMI-A-1's modeline changes. The app-ids routing is untouched, so DomU still
# lands on HDMI-A-1 (`app-ids=qemu-system-aarch64-domu,DomU`) and DomA on HDMI-A-2 --
# which is what we want, since HDMI-A-1 is the connector with the panel on it.
#
# If the bench is ever rewired to the upstream arrangement, drop this bbappend rather
# than editing it: the point is that the DEFAULT file describes upstream's wiring.

# postfuncs, not do_install:append: the shared bbappend in meta-xt-driver-domain also
# uses do_install:append to put its own unmodified weston.ini back after poky's seds,
# and the relative order of two :append fragments across layers depends on parse
# order. A postfunc is guaranteed to run after do_install and every append to it.

# 3. Same board wiring, second consequence: WHICH GUEST gets the attached panel.
#
# meta-xt-driver-domain's weston.ini routes DomU to HDMI-A-1 and DomA to HDMI-A-2, because
# on the reference bench both micro-HDMI ports have a panel. Here only micro-HDMI 1 is
# wired (measured: card0-HDMI-A-1 connected 1920x720, card0-HDMI-A-2 disconnected), so
# DomA was rendering to an output weston never creates -- nothing on screen at all.
#
# Swapping the two app-ids lists (rather than adding DomA to HDMI-A-1) keeps every app-id
# on exactly ONE output; listing DomA on both would leave kiosk-shell's choice ambiguous.
# DomU ends up on the dead output, which is acceptable WHEN DomA IS IN THE IMAGE: a 4 GiB
# SKU cannot host DomA and DomU at the same time anyway (see xt-xen-cfg-doma_%.bbappend
# for the memory budget).
#
# WHICH IS WHY THE SWAP IS GATED. ENABLE_ANDROID defaults to "no", and in a DomA-less
# build the swap has nothing to swap with: it parks the only guest there is on HDMI-A-2,
# weston creates no output for a disconnected connector, kiosk-shell has nowhere to put
# DomU's surface, and the result is a black panel with no error in any log -- the same
# invisible failure this postfunc exists to fix, just pointed at the other guest.
# RPI4_PANEL_GUEST names the guest that should own the wired port; rpi4-sodev.yaml sets
# it from the ENABLE_ANDROID override ("DomA" with Android, "DomU" without), and "DomU"
# is the default here so a bare bitbake of the DomD image matches the default config.
#
# THIS MUST STAY IN STEP WITH the touch routing in
# meta-xt-rpi4/recipes-extended/rp1-touch-forward/rp1-touch-bridge.bbappend, which points
# WL_OUTPUT at HDMI-A-1 -- the wired port -- and so follows the panel rather than the
# guest: it stays correct under either value of RPI4_PANEL_GUEST. weston drops every touch
# event whose device has no output (libweston/libinput-device.c:460), and it does NOT fall
# back to the primary output when WL_OUTPUT names a disconnected one
# (libinput-seat.c:128-138), so a mismatch between the two files is silent: the picture
# appears and touch does nothing.
